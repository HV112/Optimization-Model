Project Description

This project focuses on solving a business optimization problem using linear programming techniques. The objective of this task is to maximize total profit for a factory that produces two different products while operating under limited resources.

The problem involves a factory that manufactures Product A and Product B. Each product requires a certain amount of machine hours and labor hours. Since the availability of these resources is limited, the factory must decide how many units of each product to produce in order to achieve maximum profit without exceeding resource constraints.

Python is used as the primary programming language for this task. The PuLP library is used to formulate and solve the linear programming optimization problem. PuLP provides an easy-to-use interface for defining decision variables, objective functions, and constraints.

The optimization model is defined by setting decision variables that represent the number of units produced for each product. The objective function is designed to maximize total profit based on the profit contribution of each product. Constraints are added to ensure that machine hours and labor hours do not exceed their respective limits.

The model is then solved using PuLP’s built-in solver. After solving, the optimal number of units for Product A and Product B is obtained along with the maximum achievable profit. The results confirm that the model efficiently allocates available resources to maximize profitability.

This task demonstrates the practical application of optimization techniques in real-world business scenarios. It highlights how linear programming can be used to support decision-making in operations and production planning.
